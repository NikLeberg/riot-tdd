 *
 * # Introduction
 *
 * The Micro Kalman Filter Library
 * A library for Kalman filtering, state estimation, and sensor fusion on memory
 * constrained microncontrollers and embedded systems. The library is built on
 * top of μLAPack, a micro linear algebra package optimized for memory
 * constrained systems, and can run on any target that C can be compiled for.
 *
 * μKal is a full discrete-time Kalman Filtering library. The library can filter
 * linear, and non-linear, systems via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or
 * second-order filter (SOF).
